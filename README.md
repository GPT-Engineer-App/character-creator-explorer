# character-creator-explorer

A website similar to the character creator on D&DBeyond.com, designed for players of custom role-playing games to create and track their characters. The site should include fields for Character Name, Race, Class, Abilities, Description, and Equipment. The design should emulate the look and feel of D&DBeyond's character creator, with a focus on user-friendly navigation and an immersive, game-like interface.
